Speedin' Shotgun is 2 years old. Hooray!

To celebrate this, we here at In New Windows (3 people) decided to post our first blog post, regarding the status of the game! Hooray?

So.

## The Important News

Well..... Speedin' Shotgun is being *ENTIRELY* remade from the ground up.

Wait wait wait! Before you give me a columbian necktie and feed me to the buzzards, hear me out for a second.

## Reasons

There are MANY. I'll go over them!

The original project file is TWO YEARS OLD. ( I have progressed as developer significantly since then. )

The current codebase isn't modular at all and very hard to work with.

Implementing controller support in this project file is tedious. Very tedious.

A lot of assets were outdated, and needed a rehaul anyways.

The Level Editor's main script is about 1.5k lines long. I cannot deal with this shit anymore.


Now, with the NEW project file;

Fresh start. I am a MUCH better developer now.

The new codebase can be developed to be modular and easy to work with. ( Significant progress on this has already been made. )

Controller support has already been implemented. See for yourself!

..Ignore the visuals. Temporary.

Assets can be rehauled and replaced easily.

The Level Editor's main script is about 0 lines long. I haven't started working on it yet. ( Though, the Level Editor will be significantly more modular and easy for me to add new objects, data, and more. I've written code for this already, so I lied about it being 0 lines long. It works great. )

See!! Don't kill me!!!

## When

Well.... We don't know. Maybe 1 year? Maybe 2 years? Maybe 527 years? If I knew, then I'd tell you.

But, we have goals!

The DEMO is intended to release by the end of the year.

The FULL GAME is intended to release whenever it's done. Fuck you.

## That's it??? Nothing new???

Fine. I'll give you a song.

New main theme...

I would share more, but we're going through an overhaul right now. Come back later. And I don't want to spoil anything; there's many songs and characters!!! More than you might think!!! But you'll have to wait for the game to hear and see that!!!

## End

2 years huh? I can't wait to be done with this shit.`
